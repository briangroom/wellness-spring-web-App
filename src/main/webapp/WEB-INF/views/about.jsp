		<p>Accessories and Gym Equipment Let FreeTrainers open the world
			of personal accessories for fitness as well as home and gym equipment
			which you will need and interact with during your workouts. Many of
			these are essential and quite beneficial in helping you build the
			proper weight training plan that will help you reach your health &
			fitness goals! Clothing for exercise Whenever you go to the gym to
			exercise, you need to be comfortable. Something light which doesn't
			constrict your range of motion. Try a pair of shorts or gym pants
			with a tank top or t-shirt is appropriate. It is important to keep
			your muscles warm because it will aid with your blood flow to them.
			Please do not dress to train as if you are ready to go to a night
			club! Remember that the purpose of going to the gym is to exercise,
			not cause a fashion statement. For your feet, wear shoes which will
			not slip and slide on the ground as well as give your foot proper
			support. However, you may wear sandals or go bare foot if the
			exercise permits this and this is to your preference. Please train
			safely at all times. Wraps Wraps are used to support your joints. You
			can use them on you knees and elbows preferably. They will add
			support to these joints if they are unstable. Wraps are usually used
			for heavy training where the extra support is needed. They are also
			used when your joints are sore to relieve the stress during exercise.
			Gloves Gloves are used to aid in your grip from slipping and to help
			to prevent the build up of callases on the palms. We a
			FreeTrainers.com do not recommend the use of gloves because they
			weaken your grip over time. A glove less grip is much more secure and
			tight. Wrist Straps The use of wrist straps is to aid you in your
			exercises. They take away the strength needed in your grip so you can
			perform a few more reps. They are quite beneficial in very heavy
			movements. There is however a negative aspect to wrist straps; which
			is that you are neglecting the development of your hand grip and
			forearms. It is then preferable to go without them in the long run.

			Belt It is very important to use a weight lifting belt for exercise
			that need support for the lower back. The use of the weight lifting
			belt is often used for heavy squats. It is very important to keep in
			mind that the you should not wear the belt for EVERY exercise, since
			not all movements require its use. Free Weights Free weights are
			basically dumbbells and barbells. They are weights which are not
			attached to any machines, but free.</p>
